<!--This will serve as a website to locate various members of my family and their travels around the world.
Hopefully I can figure out how to use Google Map's API as well as Instagram's to pull in their data
and populate the site with it. Eventually I want other people to be able to figure out where their families are -->

  <!-- here, an icon picture of each family members name should pop up over whatever location they are in currently
  when you zoom in on the image, a brief profile should pop up
  this means I'd have to devise some kind of grid/coordinate system to associate each spot on the map with
  a location, and then cross-reference that location with whatever data I am pulling in -->
